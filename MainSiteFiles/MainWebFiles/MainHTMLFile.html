    <h1>Hi, my name is Jordan Hill!</h1>

<h2>About myself</h2>
<hr class="hr2">
<br>
    <p>For most of my I never knew what do, always having time to spend in which I did nothing for the most part. <br>
    During this free time, I would play random games that I found online, and mainly read alot, due to the lack of<br> of
    a social life. But, from all of that, one thing began to become more and more interesting to me over time, the<br>
    of technology. Over my childhood, I became more and more interested in it, how it worked, how to make shit, and<br>
    also, how to program. This however, was always a problem to start, as I could never focus and sit down and <br>
    learn to code</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Programming Capabilities</h3>
<hr>
<br>
    <p>My programming skills vary, but I am good in many languages, some of those
    <br> being Java, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C#. My Expertise with Java is <br>
    the best out of all my languages, with it being the first language I ever for doing<br>
    with in depth use, and wasn't scratch.</p>
