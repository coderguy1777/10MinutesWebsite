    <p class = p13>The Robot is an animated skit, meant to demonstrate abilities of texturing<br>
    within the UV Texturing software known as substance painter, and using materials created<br>

    is about a Robot, who happens to wake up, at the end of a great war between an unknown alien<br>
    race, and only lives long enough just to see the end of the war, before running out of power<br>
    and dieing, watching the sunset, and the war coming to an end.</p>
